# @spicy-hooks/utils

**General utility functions and types**

_used within the `@spicy-hooks` project, but useful for other projects as well_

While working a project you often end up with a bunch of utility functions (that you didn't find
in `lodash`) somewhere in your repo. It feels like a waste of time and good code to always
reinvent the wheel for each further project.

That's why we're publishing few utility functions and types we created
for the `@spicy-hooks` project and hoping that people will add their own so that
we can share them across the projects and eventually even across companies.

This package is a part of [the `@spicy-hooks` family](https://github.com/salsita/spicy-hooks).
Be sure to checkout the other interesting packages we offer.

## Installation

Just use the usual way:
```shell script
npm install @spicy-hooks/utils --save
```
or
```shell script
yarn add @spicy-hooks/utils
```

## Versioning

The whole `@spicy-hooks` project complies with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
The `@spicy-hooks/utils` package is however just one package from the whole project.
Seeing the major version incremented therefore doesn't necessarily mean that there
is a breaking change in this particular package. Check the
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/salsita/spicy-hooks/blob/next/packages/utils/CHANGELOG.md)
for accurate information.

It is guaranteed though, that when the major version doesn't change,
there has been no breaking change in this package.

## Issues

Please submit any issue or feature request on [the main project](https://github.com/salsita/spicy-hooks/issues). _(issue templates coming soon)_
