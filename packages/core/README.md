# @spicy-hooks/core

**React Hooks of general use.**

When working on a particular React Hooks powered project you often find yourself creating
a low level reusable hook - it just feels right with React Hooks. You then copy paste that hook
into your next project as it's simply handy. Then you add another one and another one...

Well you get the point, it's not a bad idea to have a place where we can share these hooks
across teams, projects and even companies. This place is called `@spicy-hooks/core`.

Detailed description of all included hooks is available in our
[API reference](https://spicy-hooks.salsita.co/next/modules/_core_src_index_.html).

This package is a part of [the `@spicy-hooks` family](https://github.com/salsita/spicy-hooks).

The `@spicy-hooks/core` package is however just one package from the whole project.

It is guaranteed though, that when the major version doesn't change,
